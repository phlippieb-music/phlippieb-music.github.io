title: Friends With Pools — Don't Count on Me EP
tags: band

The garage punk outfit *Friends With Pools* had ventured into a heavier direction after our debut EP release. We'd also gained an additional guitarist, Gerard Becker. We had heavier songs, and we wanted to showcase them.

We recorded the *Don't Count on Me* EP at Pony Jones Records over a weekend in February 2020, just before the pandemic really hit, and production was finished in March.
The EP was released to major streaming platforms. Listen on Spotify below:
