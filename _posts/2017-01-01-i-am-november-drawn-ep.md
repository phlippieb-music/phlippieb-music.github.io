title: I am November — Drawn EP

---

*I am November* recorded a 5-track EP called *Drawn*, opening with the previously-released *Drawn* and *Call Off*. 
It adds an up-to-date version of the song *Thinking Too Loud*, which was first heard in a stripped-down indie-folk context on *Concrete Sky*; here, it has been reworked into an upbeat pop song.
Two new tracks, *Up to Us* featuring Janey Bay and *In the Woods* featuring *I am the Carpenter*, round off the EP.

As before, the tracks were largely self-produced in our homes, using borrowed synthesiser, make-shift percussive toys, and various stringed instruments.

The EP was released to various major streaming platforms in 2017. Listen on Spotify below:
