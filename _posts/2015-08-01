title: I am November — Drawn/Call Off

---

Having recently recorded our debut EP, *I am November* set out to record two new songs, *Drawn* and *Call Off*. 
The new tracks showed a marked step up in production and style, now encased within sleek pop-rock elements in addition to the indie-folk songwriting.
Both tracks were largely produced by the band, but now featured vocals and drums recorded in-studio.

These tracks would later go on to appear on the band's last EP.
