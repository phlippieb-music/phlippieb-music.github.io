The entire recording was done on a one-track device, so the final mix was immediately dialed in with no possibility of later updates. 
We created a backtrack for the percussion in a DAW and performed everything else live, using a keyboard for electronic chirps, and a vocal pedal to colour frontman Henry's voice with autotune.
