# Lyrics

```
found afar and every car
all sound and port-bound
they all go down the old rows
a slow drift to the cold glow

your parents flown translatlantic, home
with wool coats, snow globes
I slow down near your brownstone
but head on 'cross town

afternoon with the lamps on
blazers sleep in passenger seats
and quiet sounds of touching down
and evening show curtain glow

they file by where I fall back
a slow drift to the cold glow
ordinary as family trees
it's ancient; it's gravity
```
