My current focus is on a project that has been developing in the back of my mind since as early as 2015. It will be a four or five track EP. The working title is "The Year In Cars". The songs deal with the beauty that can be mined from a year of loneliness and depression, and will feature a hybrid of traditional rock instrumentation and bedroom electronic production. All songs are being recorded at home.

Listen to a preview of the opening track, *Cars*, below:
