title: Natasha's Scenes
tags: [production music,composition]
---

I wrote and produced a short trio of incidental production music, inspired by a scene from Tolstoy's War & Peace. The music is in a light, uplifting, neo-Classical style, and is well suited to underscoring scenes in an 18th or 19th-century period production, or an idyllic scene. The slightly percussive nature of the combined piano, harp and harpsichord, along with light orchestral percussion, lends the music a subtle Eastern feel.

The three pieces share motifs, and if used together would create a sense of theme and unity. "Natasha's Kiss" also features a textural (non-melodic) postlude that can be used on its own as a mood establisher or a callback.
