title: Friends With Pools — Friends With Pools EP
tags: band
---

The garage-punk band *Friends With Pools* was formed by myself, Diffie Bosman, and frontman Louis Knoetze in 2016 as a fun side-project to our other, more serious band commitments.
We ended up enjoying it so much that it was for each of us the only band that we were still playing in by the end of the year.

We wrote a lot of songs very quickly, and recorded a five-track self-titled EP, which was completed by August 2018 and released on major streaming services. We also created the album art ourselves with a piece of cardboard and lots of cheap stickers. Listen on Spotify below:
