# Lyrics

it's just the world, it's
built for two
kept for you
kept it open
overgrown
underbloomed
underspoken

if I'd just say it
let it show
drag this fire out
through the snow, but
I did not believe in it and
you did not believe in it and
I do everything twice now
I do everything twice now

if I could heed it
closer call
harder fall
locked in orbit
not to stall
flinch or fall
scare, shy or shrink from it

if I could change it, oh
if I could change
make my dead ends rearrange, but
you lean out that way
I am not that way
I do everything twice now
I do everything twice now
