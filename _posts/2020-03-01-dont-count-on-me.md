The *Friends With Pools* sound had gotten louder and darker since our debut EP, and we'd gained an additional guitarist in Gerard Becker. 
We recorded a two-track EP, *Don't Count on Me*, at Pony Jones Records over a weekend in February 2020.

The record was released to major music streaming services in March. Listen on Spotify below:
